              This project reinforced that successful design engineering
              requires looking beyond technical requirements to understand the
              human workflows that technology should serve. The transformation
              from a data-display interface to a workflow-optimization tool
              demonstrates how user research and iterative design thinking can
              turn a technically sound but practically limited solution into
              something that genuinely improves people&apos;s daily work lives.

                User workflows trump technical elegance: A beautiful interface
                that doesn&apos;t match user mental models will fail regardless
                of technical sophistication
              </li>
              <li className="font-normal">
                Pivot when necessary: Being willing to fundamentally rethink an
                approach based on user feedback is crucial for creating truly
                useful products

                State management complexity pays dividends: The technical
                investment in optimistic updates created a seamless user
                experience that made the workflow feel natural practically

              The most rewarding aspect was seeing nonprofit officers who had
              been skeptical of changing their decades-old processes become
              advocates for the new system once they experienced the time
              savings and workflow improvements firsthand. This project showed
              me that the best design engineering solutions don&apos;t just work
              technicallyâ€”they make people&apos;s work lives genuinely better.
