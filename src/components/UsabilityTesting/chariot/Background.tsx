            Nonprofit officers were spending hours each day processing donations
            across multiple disconnected systems. Their workflow involved
            constant context switching between Excel spreadsheets, Salesforce
            and various DAF provider portals just to review and categorize a
            single donation.

            While DAFpay provided richer donation data than traditional Donor
            Advised Fund payments, nonprofits still lacked a unified interface
            to actually act on this information. They needed more than just data
            visibilityâ€”they needed workflow optimization.

                State-based workflow navigation with four key stages that match

              </li>
              <li>
                Contextual detail panels that provide comprehensive donation

                Real-time optimistic updates with intelligent state management

                donations move through the workflow
              </li>
              <li>
                Smart assignment and filtering system that allows officers to
